HITS is EDMC Plugin that gives risk assessments for ship safety upon jumping
into a star system.

The Plugin integrates with your built-in Remlok display system. It currently
supports the Windowed and Borderless mode but not yet the "FullScreen" mode
when using the "Windows" model of Remlok.

Installation
-------------

Open up EDMC's Settings menu and go to the "Plugins" tab. Click "Open" and
simply unpack the folders from the "Plugins" folder (in your downloaded zip)
into thios folder.

Once you have done this simply restart EDMC and you should see system updates
each time you jump.

Command Mode

HITS can also respond to text inpit. Simply type "!location" to get the HITS
risk report for your current system.
