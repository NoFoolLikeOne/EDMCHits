HITS - Hostile Interaction Tracking System
-------------------------------------------
(c) 3303 CMDR Ian Norton [NULL]

HITS is EDMC Plugin that gives risk assessments for ship safety upon jumping
into a star system.

The Plugin integrates with your built-in Remlok display system. It currently
supports the Windowed and Borderless mode but not yet the "FullScreen" mode
when using the "Windows" model of Remlok.

Installation
-------------

Open up EDMC's Settings menu and go to the "Plugins" tab. Click "Open" and
simply unpack the folders from the "Plugins" folder (in your downloaded zip)
into this folder.

After unpacking you will need to "unblock" the EDMCOverlay.exe program, 
either by running it or using the file properties dialog (note! this is not 
signed yet).

Once you have done the above simply restart EDMC and you should see system 
updates each time you jump.

Command Mode
-------------

HITS can also respond to text inpit. Simply type "!location" to get the HITS
risk report for your current system.
